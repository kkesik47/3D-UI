# BloxTris – VR Puzzle Game

A 3D puzzle game for Virtual Reality developed in Unity as part of Aarhus University course on **3D User Interfaces**.

The game challenges players to place a set of 3D shapes into a transparent grid using direct hand interaction in VR. To support precise object placement, the system implements **snap-to-grid mechanics** and a **ghost preview** that visualizes the potential placement before snapping.

A key focus of the project is exploring how different **snap distances** affect player experience. Four interaction conditions were implemented, each with a different snap distance, and evaluated through a user study inspired by the **AttrakDiff questionnaire**, adapted to measure the effect on **user experience, enjoyment and intuitiveness of the interaction**.

The project was designed, implemented on Unity 6000.1, and evaluated on Meta Quest 2.

**Technologies:** Unity, Meta Quest, C#, XR Interaction Toolkit
**Focus:** 3D object manipulation, snapping techniques, visual feedback, audio feedback, VR UX evaluation
